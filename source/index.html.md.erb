# Introduction

Welcome to the Alto Mission Control (MC) documenation! This documentation will describe the setup instructions and requirements for the Mission Control system developed as part of the July Alto Training Program.

# Setup Guide

The Alto Mission Control supports two deployment methods. Local and AWS.

Requirements: Node.js
              Space-track.org account

> To Setup, use this code:

```shell 
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
git clone https://github.com/altojulyspaceproject/Alto-July-Space-Project.git

cd Alto-July-space-Project
npm install
npm start

```

# Usage

There are two main use cases for the MC software developed. 
NASA openMCT usage
Direct Page Usage

Using openMCT:


1. Using web browser navigate to localhost:8080

2. Create a new webpage using openMCT modues

3. Add 'UserInput.html' as webpage module.



Using Direct Page 

1. Browse to localhost:8080/UserInput.html

Once navigated to, login using spacetrack account

Enter NORAD ID to be tracked e.g. 25544 for ISS 

Press 'Track'

Satellite Footprint : 

A satellite being tracked as it orbits the earth needs to be in direct line of sight with a ground station in order to be detected, and to send or recieving signals. A detector on the ground will have direct line of sight with the satellite when it is within the ‘footprint’ of the satellite. The footprint is a projection of the area on a map that can has direct line of sight with a satellite. The link below shows a 3D toy model of this, where a vector points to the object in question and a plane divides the sphere into that part of the sphere from which the satellite can and cannot be seen (feel free to play with the sliders).

This footprint can be represented by the 2D image below, where the horribly drawn circle is meant to represent a 2D even slice of the earth. The footprint can be represented by the distance to the edge of the footprint, swept around sphere, creating a circle of footprint, within which a ground station can see the satellite.
